Produced by Deedle-Dee Productions and Universal Media Studios, the series was created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, who served as executive producers with Howard Klein.\n\nThe comedy series focuses on Leslie Knope, the deputy director of the parks and recreation department of the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. The season consisted of six 22-minute episodes, all of which aired at 8:30 p.m. on Thursdays. Daniels and Schur conceived the show when NBC officials asked Daniels to produce a spin-off of his comedy series The Office, on which Schur was a writer. During development, the creators decided the new show would be a stand-alone series, though it would share the mockumentary style of The Office. Like that show, Parks and Recreation encouraged improvisation among its cast members.\n\nEarly test screenings were poor, and many critics and industry observers were skeptical about the show\u0027s chances of success. The first season received generally mixed to negative reviews, and several commentators found it too similar to The Office. The premiere episode was watched by 6.77 million households, but the viewership declined almost every week in the Nielsen ratings. A season low of 4.25 million households watched the final episode, \"Rock Show\". Despite the low rating, \"Rock Show\" received the best reviews of the season and convinced some critics that the series had finally found the right tone.","id":18455,"poster_path":"/szKfiau8TvZoDEUPPRA2JEyJ9N1.jpg","season_number":1}

MacDonald. The show\u0027s two seasons premiered in 2005 and 2007, and were later released on DVD. Rome is set in the 1st century BC, during Ancient Rome\u0027s transition from Republic to Empire. The series begins with Julius Caesar\u0027s conquest of Gaul, and the first season concludes with the assassination of Caesar followed by the rise of the first Emperor Augustus, also known as Gaius Octavian.\n\nThe series features a sprawling ensemble cast of characters, many of whom are based on real figures from historical records, but the lead protagonists are ultimately two soldiers, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, who find their lives intertwined with key historical events. Rome was a ratings success for HBO and the BBC. The series received much media attention from the start, and was honored with numerous awards and nominations in its two-season run. Co-creator Heller stated in December 2008 that a Rome movie was in development. The series was filmed in various locations, but most notably in the Cinecitt√† studios in Italy.","poster_path":"/o7MOqTK3Rz4wNbLYaoDT3mvqit.jpg","status":"Ended","vote_average":7.5}

Tired of cookie-cutter law school grads, Harvey takes a gamble by hiring Mike on the spot after he recognizes his raw talent and photographic memory. Mike and Harvey are a winning team. Even though Mike is a genius, he still has a lot to learn about law. And while Harvey may seem like an emotionless, cold-blooded shark, Mike\u0027s sympathy and concern for their cases and clients will help remind Harvey why he went into law in the first place. Mike\u0027s other allies in the office include the firm\u0027s best paralegal Rachel and Harvey\u0027s no-nonsense assistant Donna to help him serve justice. Proving to be an irrepressible duo and invaluable to the practice, Mike and Harvey must keep their secret from everyone including managing partner Jessica and Harvey\u0027s arch nemesis Louis, who seems intent on making Mike\u0027s life as difficult as possible.","poster_path":"/i6Iu6pTzfL6iRWhXuYkNs8cPdJF.jpg","status":"Returning Series","vote_average":7.2}
